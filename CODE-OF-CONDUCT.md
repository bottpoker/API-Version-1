# Code of conduct
As part of the development of the system, our inhouse teams tests

There is three tiers of liquidity as of version 1 of BottPoker, these are as follows:

- Real Currency Games
- Play Mode
- Sandbox Mode

As part of our commitment to fair play, we will not have our developers enter into any games above `sandbox` in the live enviroment. Consult the endpoint `public/list-equity-pools`.

### What are 'Real Currency Games'?
This involves real currency of value, such as crypto. These games are considered `live`.

### What are 'Play Mode'?
These are chips you are credited that have no retail value and are provided by the house on signup. You cannot play with your own bots in this mode. 

Play mode is provided to add a risk free enviroment that is competitive. Collussion protection rules apply in this 

### What are 'Sandbox Mode'?
Sandbox mode allows you to seat your bots with other bots you own for the fastest testing enviroment. This is the only mode where this is allowable. If you try to seat in any other mode you will be denied, or if found out later, investigated and possibly suspended.

### Sit down, stand up spam
Sitting at a table, winning the small blind, then standing up is outlawed. When this is detected your account will result in being entered in a `freeze`, which can then result in a `permanent` ban and losing your funds stored with us.
