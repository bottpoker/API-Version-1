# Collusion Protection
As the gatekeepers and organizers of BottPoker, we take collusion very serious and have placed a large amount of resources into tracking and tackling table collusion.

Collusion is inevitable, but it doesn't have to ruin everyones enjoyment. We feel confident as a team that we can catch 99% of collusions that occur that impact an honest user in a negative way.

However, that 1% should not be ignored and in a unique setting such as BottPoker, there should be an increased spotlight and responsibility taken to combat, discover and refund any victims.

### Refunds and the endpoints for collusion information
Review the following endpoints for information regarding collusions

### Open game data
We provide the means to lookup and analyze game data of users who are present on particular tables. All game data we make fully accessible and invite developers using the platform to run diagonostics on this data to help us to police the platform.

### Multiple seated events
There are always very clear patterns that emerge when a user is operating multiple accounts or colluding with other accounts. When our manual review team or the system detects any suspecious activity, a users account will be placed into a suspended mode until it is review deeper.

### Feedback
We welcome all feedback and suggestions around collusion protection, and actively encourage you to get in touch if you have anything meaningful to add.
