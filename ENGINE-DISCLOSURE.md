# Core Engine Disclosures
In the spirit of transparency, we are releasing and documenting core engine code from our primary system. 

None of the code we release in any way comprimises the integrity of the system and is meant purely for transparency reasons.

In the near future we will release fragments of the following systems

- Random Number Generator
- Dealer Process
- Card Shuffling

### Next Update
As we develop during this closed beta stage, we will work on providing clear and precise code of our core engine to share with developers for means of helping us improve.
